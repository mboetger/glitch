# Glitch

Glitch is an LLM-powered HTTP server built in Rust. This project combines the power of large language models with the efficiency and safety of the Rust programming language to create a high-performance, scalable HTTP server.

## Features

- **LLM Integration:** Utilizes large language models for handling requests and generating responses.
- **High Performance:** Built with Rust, known for its safety and performance.
- **Scalability:** Designed to handle a large number of concurrent connections.
- **Easy to Extend:** Modular architecture allows for easy integration of new features and improvements.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- **Rust:** Ensure you have Rust installed. You can install it from [rustup.rs](https://rustup.rs/).
- **LLM Library:** You may need an LLM library or API to integrate with your server.

### Installation

1. **Clone the Repository:**
